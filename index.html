				<strong>Serenity</strong> is a private investment fund founded in 2021 by Milosav A.
				Voloskov. We focus on long-term investments in ventures of proven intrinsic value to
				provide maximum possible financial security.
			</p>
			<p>Our values are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Achieving high degree of <strong>diversification</strong> to overcome local market
					instabilities. One stock may dip, but the fund will stay afloat.
				</li>
				<li>
					Carefully analyzing companies to prove their value and growth opportunities. We
					invest in companies that make money every day and rely on their
					<strong>customers</strong>, not investors.
				</li>
				<li>
					Accumulating assets to maximize <strong>financial security</strong> for our
					investors.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Why choose Serenity?</h2>
			<p>
				Serenity pays <strong>dividends</strong>. On the day of payment, Serenity calculates
				every backer's share to distribute dividends accordingly. By default, dividends are
				re-invested, but regular payouts are also an option.
			</p>
			<p>
				We make money on transparent, clear commission charges. Commissions are calculated
				individually.
			</p>
			<h2>Who invests with Serenity?</h2>
			<p>
				High-profile software developers and designers, IT team leaders and managers, curators,
				sole founders, young startup executives. People who are passionate at what they do, but
				are not necessarily passionate in finance management and analyzing the stock market.
			</p>
			<p>
				Generally speaking, our demographic are people who already have sources of substantial
				personal income, but are not yet bound by complex financial and corporate policies.
